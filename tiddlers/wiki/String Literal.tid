A ''String Literal'' in Formulas is a quoted piece of text.  `'single quotes'` or `"double quotes"` may be used.

The current parsing is quite crude, and escape sequences are not properly supported.

Strings may be concatenated with other values using the `&` [[operator|Operators]], resulting in a string.
