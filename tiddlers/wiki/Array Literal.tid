title: Array Literal
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

An ''Array Literal'' in Formulas is expressed as a pair of curly braces containing a series of [[expressions|Expression]] separated by commas.

```
{1, 2, 3, "fork"}
```

The syntax is similar to the one used in popular spreadsheet software.  2D arrays with `;` are not currently supported, however.
