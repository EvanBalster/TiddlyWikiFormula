''Formula'' for TiddlyWiki, version {{$:/plugins/ebalster/formula!!version}}, by Evan Balster.

Formulas are written between `(=` mushroom brackets `=)`.  Where possible, their functions and syntax are designed to emulate popular spreadsheet software (Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets).  They //also// support WikiText-like syntax for `{{`transclusion`}}`, `[`filters`]`, `<<`variables`>>`, and a large number of functions.

Formulas can also be evaluated by the `$formula` widget, the `$formula-vars` widget and the `<<formula>>` macro.

Further documentation is available here: [[https://evanbalster.com/tiddlywiki/formulas.html]].

This plugin is a work in progress; please report any issues on GitHub: [[https://github.com/EvanBalster/TiddlyWikiFormula/issues]].
